It's extensively used for machine learning applications and the project detailed below are two different algorithms for tracking motion between various objects.</p>\n<h1>Objective</h1>\n<p>Detect whether people have come into close contact with one another through the use of a stabilized video feed.</p>\n<h2>Method 1 - Motion Differencing</h2>\n<p>A type of image processing approach to detect motion within different adjacent video frames. As such a way to detect if anything moves can be classified as \"Moving\" and still objects in the video can be disregarded. Some fine-tune adjustment will be needed to deal with the sensitivity and speed in which people move and how many frames a video camera can capture within a second.</p>\n<h2>Method 2: Cascade Classifier</h2>\n<p>A pipeline method using multiple positive images and an arbitrary negative concerted together. Detection algorithm is based on the Viola-Jones object detection framework to deal with moving objects.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>","frontmatter":{"path":"/Detection","title":"Covid Proximity Detection"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","444233483","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
